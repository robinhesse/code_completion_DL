Course project for ["Analysing Software using Deep Learning"](https://www.sola.tu-darmstadt.de/index.php?id=13101). See the [project description](https://www.sola.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_SOLA/Teaching/summer_2017/ASDL/project_description_20170529.pdf) for details. The code is based on Michael Pradels [repository](https://github.com/michaelpradel/ASDL2017).

The best accuracy of 0.645 was reached with an Recurrent Neural Network and by using both the prefix as well as the suffix of the missing code fragment.
